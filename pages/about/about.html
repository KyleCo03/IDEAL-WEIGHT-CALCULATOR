      <li>Devine formula: <code>50.0 kg + 2.3 kg per every inch over 5 feet</code></li>
      <li>Hamwi formula: <code>48.0 kg + 2.7 kg per every inch over 5 feet</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>For women, the ideal weight calculator uses the following equations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Miller formula: <code>53.1 kg + 1.36 kg per every inch over 5 feet</code></li>  
        <li>Robinson formula: <code>49 kg + 1.7 kg per every inch over 5 feet</code></li>

      </ul>


    <h3><strong>Limitations:</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Remember that the values found with our ideal body weight calculator are not one hundred percent valid for all. As long as you are in the BMI normal weight range of 18.5 - 24.9, you are fine - don't go on a strict diet just to reach that specific number!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Also, our IBW calculator is valid for adults only. Don't use it to find the proper weight range of kids - consult a specialist instead. Also, don't use it if you are pregnant. Baseline for the calculator to work is 5 feet.
